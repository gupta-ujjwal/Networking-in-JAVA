# Networking-in-JAVA

Java programs using java.net package to create a TCP connection between two systems on network. While one of them acts as a server ,the other is the client. Server.java should run on the server with the port number as command line argument and Client.java on the client with hostname and port number(same as that of server) as command line arguments.

The default messages between server and client are Hello and GoodBye. This can be changed by changing the strings.
